    "# Speeding Up Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore how to speed up analysis of LAMMPS trajectory data with `lammpsio`. We will analyze a dump file from a simulation of a single 100-bead linear polymer represented using the Kremer–Grest model. All particles interact pairwise through the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_{\\rm WCA}(r) = 4 \\varepsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^6 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right], \\quad r \\le 2^{1/6} \\sigma.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, bonded particles interact via the FENE bond potential:\n",

    "u_{\\rm FENE}(r) = \n",

    "\n",
    "We've chosen standard model parameters of $\\sigma=1$, $\\varepsilon=1$, $R_0=1.5$, and $k=30$ in LAMMPS lj units.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've included the [LAMMPS input](lammps_input.in) and [initial configuration](init.data) files if you want to run the simulation yourself and follow along. Note that to keep compute time short, we have reduced the length of the trajectory. Averages computed from this trajectory are probably not reliable, but you can extend the simulation if you'd like to improve them!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import `lammpsio` and load the corresponding dump file."
